# Image Optimization & Customer Segmentation (K-means)

In this repository, you'll find two separate projects, each focusing on a different aspect of machine learning:

- Image Optimization using K-Means Clustering: This project leverages K-Means clustering to optimize an image by reducing the number of colors used in it. The image is segmented into distinct color clusters, resulting in a simplified version of the original image.

- Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering: This project demonstrates how to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score. The dataset used for this project is a real-world mall customer dataset (Mall_Customers.csv), which is clustered to identify distinct customer segments.

## Image Optimization Using K-Means
In this project, K-Means clustering is used to reduce the number of colors in an image while preserving its visual features. The steps involved include:

Image Preprocessing:
- Load and normalize the image data.
- Convert the image to a format suitable for clustering (RGB pixel values).

K-Means Clustering:
- The K-Means algorithm groups pixels into k clusters based on their RGB values.
- The centroids of these clusters represent the dominant colors in the image.

Image Reconstruction:
- Each pixel in the image is replaced with the closest centroid color, resulting in a simplified, color-reduced image.

Visualization:
- The original image and the optimized image are displayed side by side.
- A color palette showing the centroids used in the optimized image is also provided.

Key Features:
- Reduction of image colors using K-Means.
- Visualization of centroids and their RGB values.
- Comparison of original and optimized images.

Example Output:
- Original Image: Shows the image before optimization.
- Optimized Image: Displays the image with reduced colors based on K-Means clustering.
- Centroid Colors: Shows the dominant colors used in the optimized image.

## Customer Segmentation Using K-Means
This project focuses on customer segmentation based on their annual income and spending score. Using the Mall_Customers.csv dataset, K-Means clustering is applied to identify different customer groups.

Data Preprocessing:
- Load the dataset and clean any missing or irrelevant data.
- Select the relevant features for clustering (Annual Income and Spending Score).

K-Means Clustering:
- Apply the K-Means algorithm to cluster customers into distinct segments.
- The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Data Visualization:
- Visualize the clustering results in a 2D plot with different colors representing each customer segment.
- Optionally, a 3D plot can be generated by adding additional features like Age.

Results:
- The centroids of each cluster represent the average income and spending score of each customer group.
- The results help businesses understand customer behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

Key Features:
- The elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- 2D and 3D visualizations of customer segments.
- Clear interpretation of customer segments for targeted strategies.
